# Chowder-s-Cartoon-Adventure

## Background

Chowder's burple nurples were stolen by characters throughout the cartoon universe who just wanted a taste of Chowder's precious treat.  Chowder must go through these different worlds to retrieve his burple nurples because he is very hungry and does not like to share. He must avoid or kill his friends and enemies who have stolen his precious sweets. :hankey:

# How to Play
